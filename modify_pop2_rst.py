# repository of excellent cartography tools (among other things) can be found at https://github.com/deeplycloudy.

# Developer notes: This code could be more elegant, and because it involves several loops through data, can be
# somewhat slow. The 'nhn' interpolation method is the slowest (~35 minutes), the 'nn' method follows, and the
# 'nvn' method is the quickest. A global averaging method may be very fast in the future when it is implemented.
# Finally, this code could be rewritten to calculate exactly which locations within the grids need to be modified
# and from where for each nearest neighbor interpolation scheme, and then that matrix could be passed to all of
# the necessary components of the code to speed it up. However, this improvement will have to wait, as I am too
# busy to implement it now.

# Last few IMPORTANT notes about running this script:
#
# 1) To change the input, output, and other model variables go to the very bottom of the script, under the
#    'if name = main' conditional. These should be the only thing you need to change, unless you wish to 
#    use a different interpolation scheme, which is determined when the initialize_new_paleobath instance 
#    is created with the interp_method argument.
#
# 2) This script assumes that there are no 'overhanging' ledges in the bathymetry (i.e. land cells above 
#    water cells). If there are--and I'm not even sure that would be allowed in CESM--this code will break
#    in all kinds of places. You should probably fix those overhangs.
#
# 3) So far, this script has been built to interpolate the restart data to NEW OCEAN CELLS, and is not 
#    equipped to remove ocean cells (turning them to land cells). This addition will likely come soon, it
#    was simply not necessary so far in this research project. It may not even be necessary, so long as 
#    KMT file of the new paleobathymetry is accurate. Not sure exactly how CESM would handle that.

class CoordinateSystem(object):
    """The abstract coordinate system handling provided here works as follows.

    Each coordinate system must be able to convert data to a common coordinate system, which is chosen to be ECEF cartesian.
    data -> common system
    common system -> dislpay coordinates
    This is implemented by the fromECEF and toECEF methods in each coordinate system object.
    User code is responsible for taking data in its native coord system,
        transforming it using to/fromECEF using the a coord system appropriate to the data, and then
        transforming that data to the final coordinate system using another coord system.

    This class maintains an attribute WGS84xyz that can be used in
        transformations to/from the WGS84 ECEF cartesian system, e.g.
        >>> WGS84lla = proj4.Proj(proj='latlong', ellps='WGS84', datum='WGS84')
        >>> projectedData = proj4.transform(WGS84lla, coordinateSystem.WGS84xyz, lat, lon, alt )
    The ECEF system has its origin at the center of the earth, with the +Z toward the north pole,
        +X toward (lat=0, lon=0), and +Y right-handed orthogonal to +X, +Z

    Depends on pyproj, http://code.google.com/p/pyproj/ to handle the ugly details of
    various map projections, geodetic transforms, etc.

    but messier, and without an obvious winner like UTF-8." - Django OSCON tutorial, 2007
